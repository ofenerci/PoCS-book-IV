\section{Modelling Complex Networks}

  \textbf{Models}

  \textbf{Some important models:}
    
     generalized random networks
     scale-free networks
     small-world networks
     statistical generative models ($p^\ast$)
     generalized affiliation networks
    
  
  

  \textbf{Models}

  \textbf{1. generalized random networks:}
    
     Arbitrary degree distribution $P_k$.
     Wire nodes together randomly.
     Create ensemble to test deviations from randomness.
    
  
  

  \textbf{Models}

  \textbf{2. `scale-free networks':}
    
     Introduced by Barabasi and Albert\cite{barabasi1999a}
     Generative model
     Preferential attachment model with growth:
      $P[\rm \mbox{attachment to node}\ i] \propto k_{i}^\alpha$.
     Produces \alert{$P_k \sim k^{-\gamma}$} when $\alpha=1$.
     Trickiness: other models generate skewed degree distributions.
    
  


  \textbf{Models}

  \textbf{3. small-world networks}
    
     Introduced by Watts and Strogatz\cite{watts1998a}
    
    \medskip
    {Two scales:}
    
     \alert{local regularity} (an individual's friends know each other)
     \alert{global randomness} (shortcuts).
    

          
      
       Shortcuts allow disease to jump
       Number of infectives increases exponentially in time
