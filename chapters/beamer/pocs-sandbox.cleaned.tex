Heavy-tailed distributions of meme popularity occur naturally in a model of meme diffusion on social networks. Competition between multiple memes for the limited resource of user attention is identified as the mechanism that poises the system at criticality. The popularity growth of each meme is described by a critical branching process, and asymptotic analysis predicts power-law distributions of popularity with very heavy tails (exponent α<2, unlike preferential-attachment models), similar to those seen in empirical data.

  \textbf{Random walks on networks---basics:}

  
  
    Imagine a single random walker moving
    around on a network.
   
    At $t=0$, start walker at node $j$ and 
    take time to be discrete.
   
    \alert{Q:} What's the long term probability distribution
    for where the walker will be?
   

    Define \alertb{$p_i(t)$} as the probability
    that at time step $t$, our walker is at node $i$.
   
    We want to characterize the evolution
    of $\vec{p}(t)$.
   
    First task: connect $\vec{p}(t+1)$ to $\vec{p}(t)$.
   
    {Let's call our walker \alert{Barry}.}
   
    {Unfortunately for Barry,
      he lives on a high dimensional graph and is far from home.}
  
    {Worse still: Barry is \alertb{hopelessly drunk}.}
  


\renewcommand{\insertlecturelogo}{
  \includegraphics[height=0.1\textheight]{scrabbleletters2-tp.pdf}
}

  \textbf{Where is Barry?}

  
  
    Consider simple directed, ergodic (strongly connected) networks.
  
    As usual, represent network by \alert{adjacency matrix $A$}
    where
    $$
    \begin{array}{l}
      a_{ij}=1 \ \mbox{if $i$ has an edge leading to $j$}, \\
      a_{ij}=0 \ \mbox{otherwise.}
    \end{array}
    $$
  
    Barry is at node $i$ at time $t$ with probability $p_i(t)$.
  
    In the next time step he 
    \alertb{randomly lurches} toward one of $i$'s neighbors.
  
    Equation-wise:
    $$
      p_i(t+1) = \sum_{j=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k_i}  a_{ji} p_j(t).
    $$
    where $k_i$ is $i$'s degree.
    {Note: $k_i = \sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{ij}$.}
  


  \textbf{Where is Barry?}

  
  
    Linear algebra-based excitement:
    $
    p_i(t+1) = \sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{ji} \frac{1}{k_j} p_j(t)
    $
    is more usefully viewed as
    $$
    \vec{p}(t+1) 
    = 
    A^{\textnormal{T}} K^{-1}
    \vec{p}(t) 
    $$
    where $[K_{ij}] = [\delta_{ij} k_i]$ 
    has node degrees on the main diagonal
    and zeros everywhere else.
  
    So... we need to find the \alert{dominant eigenvalue} 
    of $A^{\textnormal{T}} K^{-1}$.
  
    Expect this eigenvalue will be 1 (doesn't make sense
    for total probability to change).
  
    The corresponding eigenvector will be the limiting
    probability distribution (or invariant measure).
  
    Extra concerns: multiplicity of eigenvalue = 1,
    and network connectedness.
  


  \textbf{Where is Barry?}

  
  
    By inspection, we see that
    $$
    \vec{p}(\infty) = \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} k_i} \vec{k}
    $$
    satisfies
    $
    \vec{p}(\infty)
    = 
    A^{\textnormal{T}} K^{-1}
    \vec{p}(\infty)
    $
    with eigenvalue 1.
  
    We will find Barry at node $i$ with probability
    proportional to its degree $k_i$.
  
    Nice implication: probability of finding Barry travelling along
    any edge is \alert{uniform}.
  
    Diffusion in real space smooths things out.
  
    On networks, uniformity occurs on edges.
  
    So in fact, diffusion in real space is \alertb{about the edges too}
    but we just don't see that.
  


  \textbf{Other pieces:}

  
  
    Goodness: $A^{\textnormal{T}} K^{-1}$ is similar to a real symmetric matrix
    if $A = A^{\textnormal{T}}$.
  
    Consider the transformation $M = \alertb{K^{-1/2}}$:
    $$
    \alertb{K^{-1/2}}
    \alert{A^{\textnormal{T}} K^{-1}}
    \alertb{K^{1/2}}
    =
    \alertb{K^{-1/2}}
    \alert{A^{\textnormal{T}}}
    \alertb{K^{-1/2}}.
    $$
  
    Since $A^{\textnormal{T}} = A$, we 
    have 
    $$
    ({K^{-1/2}}
    {A}
    {K^{-1/2}})^{\textnormal{T}}
    =
    {K^{-1/2}}
    {A}
    {K^{-1/2}}.
    $$
  
    Upshot: $A^{\textnormal{T}} K^{-1} = A K^{-1}$ has real eigenvalues and a complete
    set of orthogonal eigenvectors.
  
    Can also show that maximum eigenvalue magnitude is indeed 1.
  
    Other goodies: next time round.

  The role of universality and accidents not being understood.
  
  \url{https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/context/gell-mann-hartle-spin-quantum-narrative-about-reality}


  
Douglas Adams

The world is a thing of utter inordinate complexity and richness and
strangeness that is absolutely awesome. I mean the idea that such
complexity can arise not only out of such simplicity, but probably
absolutely out of nothing, is the most fabulous extraordinary
idea. And once you get some kind of inkling of how that might have
happened, it's just wonderful. And ... the opportunity to spend 70 or 80
years of your life in such a universe is time well spent as far as I
am concerned.

Response to the question "What is it about science that really gets
your blood running?" — as quoted in Richard Dawkins in his eulogy for
Adams (17 September 2001)

\url{http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams}

If you try and take a cat apart to see how it works, the first thing
you have on your hands is a nonworking cat. Life is a level of
complexity that almost lies outside our vision; it is so far beyond
anything we have any means of understanding that we just think of it
as a different class of object, a different class of matter; 'life',
something that had a mysterious essence about it, was God given, and
that's the only explanation we had. The bombshell comes in 1859 when
Darwin publishes On the Origin of Species. It takes a long time before
we really get to grips with this and begin to understand it, because
not only does it seem incredible and thoroughly demeaning to us, but
it's yet another shock to our system to discover that not only are we
not the centre of the Universe and we're not made by anything, but we
started out as some kind of slime and got to where we are via being a
monkey. It just doesn't read well.

%% Politics, too, is falling to the new psychohistorians. Boleslaw Szymanski of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York state studies how societies change their collective minds. By studying simulated networks of people he can predict the point at which a committed minority can convert almost everyone else to its way of thinking. For an idealised model, the size of this catalytic minority is just under 10\%. Tweaking the model with data from real networks such as Twitter and Facebook, he hopes, will allow these insights to be applied to the real world.

plus horvitz

The ``six degrees'' concept dates to a 1929 short story, ``Chains,''
in which Frigyes Karinthy, the Hungarian author, suggested that no one
is more than a string of six friends away from any other person.

After Milgram published his famous paper ``The Small World Problem,''
in 1967, the playwright John Guare made ``Six Degrees of Separation,''
the title of a 1990 play that explored Milgram’s premise. And that
gave rise to the parlor game Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, in which
disparate Hollywood personalities are linked to one another. (Elvis
Presley was in ``Change of Habit'' with Edward Asner; Mr. Asner was in
``J.F.K.'' with Kevin Bacon.)
 

The Facebook paper, titled ``Four Degrees of Separation,'' notes that
Milgram posed both an optimistic interpretation of his findings and a
pessimistic one.

On one hand, it is a startling notion that reaching someone on the
other side of the world takes only a small group of social
connections. On the other hand, Milgram said, the result could also be
evidence of psychological distance: that we were actually, on average,
five ``worlds apart.''
 
 ``From this gloomier perspective,'' the new paper says, ``it is
reassuring to see that our findings show that people are in fact only
four worlds apart, and not five.''

Control Centrality and Hierarchical Structure in Complex Networks

%%   We introduce the concept of control centrality to quantify the
%% ability of a single node to control a directed weighted network. We
%% calculate the distribution of control centrality for several real
%% networks and find that it is mainly determined by the network’s degree
%% distribution. We show that in a directed network without loops the
%% control centrality of a node is uniquely determined by its layer index
%% or topological position in the underlying hierarchical structure of
%% the network. Inspired by the deep relation between control centrality
%% and hierarchical structure in a general directed network, we design an
%% efficient attack strategy against the controllability of malicious
%% networks.

It would therefore be naive to believe that systematic error is a problem for biomedicine alone. It is likely to be prevalent in any field that seeks to predict the behaviour of complex systems---economics, ecology, environmental science, epidemiology and so on. The cracks will be there, they are just harder to spot because it is harder to test research results through direct technological applications (such as drugs) and straightforward indicators of desired outcomes (such as reduced morbidity and mortality).

Title: Statistical Outliers and Dragon-Kings as Bose-Condensed Droplets
Authors: V. I. Yukalov and D. Sornette
Categories: physics.soc-ph q-fin.GN quant-ph
Comments: Latex file, 16 pages, 1 figure
Journal-ref: Eur. Phys. J. Spec. Top. 205 (2012) 53-64
\\
?A theory of exceptional extreme events, characterized by their abnormal sizes
compared with the rest of the distribution, is presented. Such outliers, called
"dragon-kings", have been reported in the distribution of financial drawdowns,
city-size distributions (e.g., Paris in France and London in the UK), in
material failure, epileptic seizure intensities, and other systems. Within our
theory, the large outliers are interpreted as droplets of Bose-Einstein
condensate: the appearance of outliers is a natural consequence of the
occurrence of Bose-Einstein condensation controlled by the relative degree of
attraction, or utility, of the largest entities. For large populations, Zipf's
law is recovered (except for the dragon-king outliers). The theory thus
provides a parsimonious description of the possible coexistence of a power law
distribution of event sizes (Zipf's law) and dragon-king outliers.

Kauffman:

Dom warm thanks. Hello Peter, and hello Claire and Gary, I look forward to meeting you. A brief statement of my own interests in cancer. For
some years I have been thinking about cancer differentiation therapy. With wonderful Dr. Sui Huang, who i stole from Harvard Med School to join
me at the University of Calgary several years ago, we have taken a breast cancer cell line, individually screened 1500 FDA approved drugs and
found 16 that induce what appears to be differentiation to normal adult breast cells. Sui has just completed gene arrays on these 16 drugs with
3 time points in each treatment, to test if the 16 all induce the same changes or different changes in gene expression patterns. Obviously this
is encouraging, with a long way to go before it may be clinically relevant. ?
The central idea behind this work is an old theory, initially derived from a 1963 article by Jacob and Monod, that genetic regulatory circuits
could have multiple alternative stable or recurrent patterns of gene activities called "attractors", and that different cell types are
different attractors in the behavior of the same genetic regulatory net. Then differentiation is a perturbation or signal that "kicks" the
genetic dynamical network from one attractor to another. And cancer, with our without mutations, may often have normal cell type attractors to
which malignant cells can be induced to differentiate.
I'd be anxious to hear your lines of thought, Claire and Gary, if you'd care to share them. And I look very much forward to interacting before
and when I get to UVM next Fall.

  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figrandomwalk_firstreturn_noname.pdf}
  
  
    A \alertg{return} to origin can only happen when $t = 2n$.
  
    In example above, returns occur at $t=8$, 10, and 14.
  
    Call $P_{\textrm{fr}(2n)$ the probability of \alertg{first return} at $t=2n$.

    (combinatorics/statistical mechanics).
  
    \alertb{Idea:} Transform first return problem into an easier return problem.
%%      $$P_{\textrm{fr}(2n) = 2 Pr(x_{t} \ge 1, t=1,\ldots,2n-1, \ \mbox{and} \  x_{2n} =0). $$

      Can assume drunkard first lurches to $x=1$.
     
      Observe walk first returning at $t=16$ stays at or above $x=1$ for $1 \le t \le 15$
      (dashed \alert{red} line).
     
      Now want walks that can return many times to $x=1$.
     
      $P_{\textrm{fr}(2n) = $ \\
      $2\cdot\frac{1}{2}Pr(x_{t} \ge 1, 1 \le t \le 2n-1, \ \mbox{and} \  x_1 = x_{2n-1} = 1) $
     
      The $\frac{1}{2}$ accounts for $x_{2n}=2$ instead of 0.
     
      The $2$ accounts for drunkards that first lurch to $x=-1$.
    
  


  \textbf{Counting first returns:}

  \textbf{Approach:}
    
    
      Move to counting numbers of walks.
    
      Return to probability at end.
    
      Define 
      $N(i,j,t)$ as the \# of possible walks between $x=i$ and $x=j$ taking $t$ steps.
     
      Consider \alert{all paths} starting at $x=1$ and ending at $x=1$ after $t=2n-2$ steps.
     
      \alertb{Idea:} If we can compute the number of walks that hit $x=0$ at least once, then we can
      subtract this from the total number to find the ones that maintain $x \ge 1$.
     
      Call walks that drop below $x=1$ \alertb{excluded walks}.
     
      We'll use a method of images to identify these excluded walks.
    
  


%%  \textbf{First Returns:}

  \textbf{Examples of excluded walks:}

    \end{center}
  

    \textbf{Key observation for excluded walks:}
      
        
        For any path starting at $x$$=$$1$ that hits 0,
        there is a unique matching path starting at $x$$=$$-1$.
         
        Matching path first mirrors and then tracks after first reaching $x$$=$$0$.
      
        \# of $t$-step paths starting and ending at $x$$=$$1$

          =
          \alert{\frac{\mu}{A_k}}
          \prod_{j=1}^{k}

      \textbf{Universality?}

    
      
      
        Time for pure excitement: Find \alert{asymptotic behavior} 
        of $n_k$ given $A_k \rightarrow k$ as $k \rightarrow \infty$.
      
        For large $k$:
        $$
        n_k = 
        \frac{\mu}{A_k}
        \prod_{j=1}^{k}
        \frac{1}{1 + \frac{\mu}{A_j}}
        {
          =
          \frac{\mu}{A_k}
          \prod_{j=1}^{k}
          \frac{A_j}{A_j + \mu}
        }
        $$
        {
          $$
          =
          \frac{\mu}{\alert{\cancel{A_k}}}
          \frac{A_1}{(A_1+\mu)}
          \frac{A_2}{(A_2+\mu)}
          \cdots
          \frac{k-1}{(k-1+\mu)}
          \frac{\alert{\cancel{k}}}{(k+\mu)}
          $$
        }
        $$
        {
          \propto
          \frac{\Gamma(k)}{\Gamma(k + \mu + 1)}
        }
        {
          \sim
          \frac{\sqrt{2\pi} k^{k+1/2} e^{-k}}
          {\sqrt{2\pi} (k+\mu+1)^{k+\mu+1+1/2}e^{-(k+\mu+1)}}
        }
        $$
        $$
        {
          \alert{ \propto k^{-\mu-1} }
        }
        $$
      
        Since $\mu$ depends on $A_k$, \alert{details matter...}
      
    

  
      \textbf{Universality?}

    
      
      
        Now we need to find $\mu$.
      
        Our assumption again:
        $
        \alertb{A = \mu t = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} N_k(t) A_k}
        $
      
        Since $N_k = n_k t$, we have the simplification
        $
        \alertb{
          \mu = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} n_k A_k}
        $
      
        Now subsitute in our expression for $n_k$:
                  
          $$
          \mu = 
          \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} 
          \alert{
            \frac{\mu}{A_k}
            \prod_{j=1}^{k}
            \frac{1}{1 + \frac{\mu}{A_j}}
          }
          A_k
          $$
          
          $$
          \mu = 
          \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} 
          \frac{\mu}{\alert{\cancel{A_k}}}
          \prod_{j=1}^{k}
          \frac{1}{1 + \frac{\mu}{A_j}}
          \alert{\cancel{A_k}}
          $$
                
          $$
          \alertb{1 \cancel{\mu}} = 
          \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} 
          \frac{\alertb{\cancel{\mu}}}{\alert{\cancel{A_k}}}
          \prod_{j=1}^{k}
          \frac{1}{1 + \frac{\mu}{A_j}}
          \alert{\cancel{A_k}}
          $$
              
        Closed form expression for $\mu$.
      
        We can solve for $\mu$ in some cases.
      
        Our assumption that $A = \mu t$ is okay.
      
    

  
      \textbf{Universality?}

    
      
      
        Turns out we can adjust $A_k$ and tune $\gamma$
        to be anywhere in $[2,\infty)$.
      
        $\gamma = 2$ is the lower limit since
        $$
        \mu = 
        \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} A_k n_k 
        \sim
        \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} k n_k
        $$
        must be finite.
      
        Let's now look at a specific example of $A_k$
        to see this range of $\gamma$ is possible.

    Into every generation a Slayer is born: one girl in all the world, a
    Chosen One. She alone will wield the strength and skill to fight the
    vampires, demons, and the forces of darkness; to stop the spread of
    their evil and the swell of their numbers. She is the Slayer.
