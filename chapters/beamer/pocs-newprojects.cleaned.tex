  \textbf{Computational Linguistics}

  Explore collaboration networks.

We have a similar project for the ACL Anthology:

http://belobog.si.umich.edu/clair/anthology/index.cgi

All papers in Computational Linguistics with manually curated and
deduped networks: 11K papers, 7K authors, 40K links (paper citation
networks), 150K links (author citation network), 45K links (author
collaboration network).

We use our open-source system called clairlib (www.clairlib.org) to
analyze the network data.
