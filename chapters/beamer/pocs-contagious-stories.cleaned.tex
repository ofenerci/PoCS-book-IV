%% Intro:

%% I'm going to talk about two things:
%% what i'll call the paradox of fame, of superstars,
%% and the mystery of social contagion, of superspreading,
%% and i'll give you the secrets to these things, all for free.

%% Everything I say will be likely completely obvious or completely wrong.

  %% we would never go back and find the match and say this is what caused a devastating bushfire

  ``The only real way to optimize for social spread is in the nature of
  the content itself. There's no way to game email or people's instant
  messages. There's no power users you can contact. There's no
  algorithms to understand. This is pure social, uncut.''

%%  Loop back to Harry Potter.
%%
%%  Picture?
%%  But remember, your novel really may be terrible
%%  and may never take off in any decent society.


  
  \textbf{Social contagion}

  \textbf{Summary}
    

     \alert{`Influential vulnerables'} are key to spread.
     Early adopters are mostly vulnerables.
     Vulnerable nodes important but not necessary.
     Groups may greatly facilitate spread.
     Seems that cascade condition is a global one.
     Most extreme/unexpected cascades occur in highly connected networks 
     `Influentials' are posterior constructs.\\
     Many potential influentials exist.
    
  
  

%% %%   \textbf{Summary}
%% 
%%   
%% %   Cascade initiators not greatly above average.
%% %   Average initiators easier to find and influence.
%% %   Early adopters may be above or below average.
%%   
%% 
%% 
  \textbf{Social contagion}

  \textbf{Implications}
  
  
    Focus on \alertb{the influential vulnerables}.
  
    Create entities that can be transmitted successfully
    through many individuals rather than broadcast from one `influential.'
  
    Only \alertb{simple ideas} can spread by word-of-mouth.\\
    \qquad (Idea of opinion leaders spreads well...)
  
    Want enough individuals who will adopt and display.
  
    Displaying can be \alertb{passive} = free (yo-yo's, fashion),\\
    or \alertb{active} = harder to achieve (political messages).
  
    Entities can be novel or designed to combine with others,
    e.g. block another one.

Dark social: semaphore

Use of `like.'

Superstars dominate but are unpredictable.  Why?

Section on imitation:
Lyrebird?

Copying: My accent.  
How I would like to speak, how I actually speak.

Closing remark: Never give up.  Keep trying.

Confederacy of Dunces.

We make two kinds of mistakes about success,
of different levels of sophistication.

1. We think it's only about the thing itself.
``Content is King.''

2. Once we see that the social element
matters, that luck matters, we try to capitalize
by manipulating social interactions.
Amway, certain religions, BuzzAgent, Facebook.

Give examples of ads where people mention
how they tell all their friends.

The end story is that ``Content is King'' but 
with an understanding of the power of 
distributed average people in social networks
and the lack of power of supposedly key individuals.

Part of the regal content has to be socially based.

I can haz cheezburger.
Buzzfeed has capitalized on this.

Jokes, surprises,

And news.

Example of a great joke.
A visual joke.

People have to both enjoy receiving, seeing, 
experiencing the thing spreading.  
An idea, an experience, a way of talking,
And then they have to be motivated to share.
That they will gain some benefit, some
enjoyment

Say something about stories and language.

All of this can be used for good and bad.
Language can be used for good and bad.


Over and over, we tell a story after the fact
that explains everything.

We're storytellers, teleology rules our minds.

Why is global success so unpredictable?
Making sense of influence, social contagion, marketing, and stories.

Social imitation is everywhere.  But there's a weird limit. 
If you start dressing exactly like your best friend,
they you're a psycho.  Emulation is okay

Social element of success.

Influentials
Social element of spreading.

The enormous power of imitation,
cultural replication.

Sociotechnical.

Contagion


Why is the idea of influentials so influential?

1. Because we much more readily understand individuals
than groups.

2. We take hold of the influential idea because
we can then see how to pay for it.

Homo narrativus.

There is some understanding that social contagion matters 
but the most prominent reactions again have been,
I believe, poorly constructed.  Facebook acts as
some strange character at a party who knows (or wants
to know) what everyone has been doing and bought,
and then broadcasts to everyone else.  It's just unnatural.

Sharing has to remain organic.

The solution: make `better' products.

Content is King.

Make things that people will want to share.

Things that are forced will not go beyond two
steps into the social network.  Away from
the source, the message has to carry itself.

For successful spreading via word-of-moth to work, 
there are two main requirements:

1. People must somehow benefit from hearing
the message, and then must want to pass it on.

2. The message must not degrade or change.

Jokes make great examples.

(Think of a great joke.)

  ``The only real way to optimize for social spread is in the nature of
  the content itself. There's no way to game email or people's instant
  messages. There's no power users you can contact. There's no
  algorithms to understand. This is pure social, uncut.''
