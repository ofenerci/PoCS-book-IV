{Conclusions}

 clusions}
   
   
     
      
       For this model, epidemic size is highly unpredictable
      
       Model is more complicated than SIR but still simple
      
       We haven't even included normal social responses 
       such as travel bans and self-quarantine.
      
       The reproduction number $R_0$ is not terribly useful.
      
       $R_0$, however measured, is not informative
       about 
       
        
         how likely the observed epidemic size was,
        
         and how likely future epidemics will be.
       
      
       Problem: $R_0$ summarises \alertb{one} epidemic after the fact
       and enfolds movement, the price of bananas, everything.
     
   

 s}

   
     
      Disease spread highly sensitive to population structure
      \alertb{Rare events may matter enormously}\\
       {(e.g., an infected individual taking
         an international flight)}
      \alertb{More support for controlling population movement}\\
       {(e.g., travel advisories, quarantine)}
     
   
 
 s}

 \textbf{What to do:}
   
    Need to separate movement from disease
    $R_0$ needs a friend or two.
    Need $R_0>1$ and $P_0>1$ and $\xi$ sufficiently large\\
     for disease to have a chance of spreading
   
 

 \textbf{More wondering:}
   
    Exactly how important are rare events in disease spreading?
    Again, what is $N$?

  \textbf{``Greenspan Concedes Error on Regulation''}
    
    
      \ldots humbled Mr.\ Greenspan admitted that he had put too much
      faith in the self-correcting power of free markets \ldots
%      and had failed
%      to anticipate the self-destructive power of wanton mortgage
%      lending.
    
      ``Those of us who have looked to the self-interest of lending
      institutions to protect shareholders' equity, myself included,
      are in a state of shocked disbelief''
     
      Rep.\ Henry
      A.\ Waxman: ``Do you feel
      that your ideology pushed you to make decisions that you wish
      you had not made?''
     
      Mr. Greenspan conceded: ``Yes, I've found a flaw. I don't know
      how significant or permanent it is. But I've been very
      distressed by that fact.''

      [NYT] But there are at least 15,000 professional economists in this
