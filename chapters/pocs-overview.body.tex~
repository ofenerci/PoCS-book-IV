  \textbf{Grading breakdown:}

  
    
     
      \alertb{Projects/talks (36\%)}---Students will 
      work on semester-long projects.  Students will develop a
      proposal in the first few weeks of the course which will be discussed
      with the instructor for approval.  

      \smallskip

      Details: 12\% for the first talk, 12\% for the final talk,
      and 12\% for the written project.
    
  
  
    
     
      \alertb{Assignments (60\%)}---All assignments will be 
      of equal weight and there will be nine or ten of them.
    
  
  
    
     
      \alertb{General attendance/Class participation (4\%)}
    
  


  \textbf{How grading works:}

  \textbf{Questions are worth 3 points according to the following scale:}
    
     
      3 = correct or very nearly so.
     
      2 = acceptable but needs some revisions.
     
      1 = needs major revisions.
     
      0 = way off.

  \textbf{Feynmann:}
    If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be
    destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generation of
    creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the
    fewest words? I believe it is the atomic hypothesis that all things
    are made of atoms---little particles that move around in perpetual
    motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart,
    but repelling upon being squeezed into one another. In that one
    sentence, you will see, there is an enormous amount of information
    about the world, if just a little imagination and thinking are
    applied.

  \textbf{Complexity Manifesto:}
    
    
      Systems are ubiquitous and systems matter.
    
      Consequently, much of science is about understanding
      how pieces dynamically fit together.
    
      1700 to 2000 = Golden Age of Reductionism.
      
       
        Atoms!, sub-atomic particles, DNA, genes, people, ...
      
    
      Understanding and creating systems (including new `atoms')
      is the greater part of science and engineering.
    
      Universality: systems with quantitatively different micro details
      exhibit qualitatively similar macro behavior.
    
      Computing advances make the Science of Complexity possible:
      
      
        We can measure and record enormous amounts of data,
        research areas continue to transition from data scarce to data rich.
      
        We can simulate, model, and create complex systems
        in extraordinary detail.
