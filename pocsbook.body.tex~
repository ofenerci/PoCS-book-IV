``And what’s more, the Dundee Advertiser loved the book and recommended it to readers. When the author, it noted, wrote of maths, “he never fails to translate his mathematics into English; and he is one of the relatively few men of science who can write in flawless English and who never grudge the effort to make every sentence balanced and good.”''


The Unfollower Monks of the Infinitely Many Wrong Paths.
Our Unguides.

Monk life spans

Monks does suggest men in cowls.
I would hope you will be able to imagine monks of all kinds
and that the cowls and the suffering are the key features.
Octopus monks for example.

Finders and Unfollowers.

Workmonks.

Part A:

The first 40 minutes of the second lecture of PoCS this Fall covers
1. The definition of Complex Systems (not "A", "The")
2. Reductionism, the Golden Age thereof,
3. The Manifesto,

The video is housed within the course's episodes page:

and on youtube:

Manifesto slides are here:

Part B:

I came up with the manifesto exactly for the reasons you mentioned today.  People kept coming up saying complex systems
aren't defined and I would say no, they are, here it is.  And then I was compelled to lay out the bigger framing of how
science simply must unfold (whether we're octopuses or people).

Part C:

The rest of the lecture above and then the next one are on scaling,
and travels across all kinds of systems.  Includes the awesome Buckingham $\pi$ Theorem.
Everything from physical to biological to sociotechnical.
This is a new structuring of the course I introduced this year
and it feels very good.  Power law size distributions follow---description
then a laying out of major mechanisms.

Why did I write this book?

\begin{enumerate}
\item 
  First: Complex Systems absolutely are a thing and can be defined well
  enough.  We'll get to this soon.
\item 
  We now understand that there are universal features and properties
  of systems---stories---that at least touch all fields dealing
  with complex systems.
\item 
  I want to share what I've gleaned over 20+ years of
  becoming a scientist wanting to understand the story of everything.
\end{enumerate}



The Schelling model remains our archetypal example.  Simple to
describe micro dynamics leading to interesting/meaningful macro
phenomena which gives us a new narrative of collective behaviour
(which we are ill placed to intuit).

Religion:

Successful religions have, ironically, been in part 
a result of natural selection of stories.


Not believing in evolution is an evolutionary outcome.


Soon after arriving at the University of Vermont,
I began constructing my two courses on Complex Systems
in the 2007:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
  Principles of Complex Systems.
  \todo{Include logo}
\item 
  Complex Networks.
\end{itemize}

The two, three, no four!, main goals of this book:

Why do we need the science of complexity to tackle the most difficult
questions?

We only need a Science of Complexity if such a thing exists.
Step 1: What we need to understand is complexity.
